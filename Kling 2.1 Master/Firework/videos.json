    "prompt": "A cinematic rainy city square at night, crowded with people holding umbrellas, neon signs glowing in the background. The camera holds on a young woman in a bright pink dress holding a small dog, standing still in the center of the frame. Behind her, the dark sky suddenly lights up with a series of fireworks — red, gold, and blue bursts exploding above the skyline. The fireworks illuminate the wet pavement and the reflections of umbrellas, creating a dramatic and vibrant atmosphere. The contrast between the calm, steady woman in the foreground and the celebratory fireworks in the background builds a striking cinematic moment. Smooth camera movement with subtle handheld realism, maintaining focus on the woman while the fireworks unfold in the sky.",

    "prompt": "A cinematic urban street in bright daylight, a young woman with long hair wearing a vivid red top and metallic silver skirt poses on a red bicycle near a brick wall, sunlight casting sharp shadows across the sidewalk, the camera begins with a steady handheld medium shot and gently drifts closer to her face while keeping the bicycle in frame, in the background cars move naturally along the street, and the clear blue sky above suddenly erupts with colorful fireworks in red, gold, and blue, their glow reflecting subtly on the building windows and car roofs, the celebratory bursts contrast with the calm confident pose of the woman, creating a surreal yet cinematic atmosphere.",
