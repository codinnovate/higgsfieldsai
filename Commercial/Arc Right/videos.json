    "prompt": "A young woman in a black leather jacket sings into a studio microphone in a dimly lit recording booth. The camera performs a slow, cinematic arc around her, capturing her focused expression, subtle movements, and the glow of the soundboard lights behind her. As she delivers emotional vocals, the arc reveals the analog mixing console, speakers, and acoustic panels from multiple angles. The atmosphere is intimate and artistic. The styling evokes vintage music documentaries with a slight analog filter, shallow depth of field, warm highlights, and a soft filmic grain. Subtle flickers from the “REC” light and analog tape overlays add to the studio realism."

    "prompt": "A young man stands motionless in the middle of an urban street, dressed in a loose dark gray suit and black shoes. Behind him, scooters are parked under a striped awning in front of a closed storefront. In his hand, he holds a burning newspaper — flames licking upwards, edges curling, smoke trailing into the air. His expression is calm and focused, eyes fixed on the fire as the paper begins to rise from his grip, carried by an unseen draft. The camera executes a slow arc to the right, starting from his left-front angle and gliding toward his right profile. As the arc progresses, the burning newspaper begins to lift upward, breaking free from his hand and ascending slowly, flame trailing and pieces disintegrating into ash. The man follows its path with his eyes only, never moving his body. The shifting perspective reveals more of the scooters and storefront behind him, with a slight lens flare from the fire’s glow. Ensure fire and smoke behave naturally — flickering, distorting air, and lighting his face and hand subtly. The newspaper must rise smoothly with believable motion physics, breaking apart as it ascends. The man’s body must remain completely still; only eye movement should track the paper. Background elements like scooters and signage must stay consistent and stable throughout the arc."

    "prompt": "A graceful woman in a flowing, colorful dress dances slowly under a soft spotlight in a dark room. The camera arcs gently around her as she moves, capturing the fluid motion of her arms and fabric as they ripple through the air. Her expression is serene, eyes closed, completely immersed in the rhythm. The light follows her softly, casting delicate shadows across her skin and highlighting the textures of the dress. The camera movement is smooth and intimate, staying close as it circles, shifting perspective with each step. The atmosphere is poetic and meditative. Styling is minimal stage elegance with rich color, cinematic softness, and ethereal lighting."

    "prompt": "A lone superhero stands motionless amidst the rubble of a destroyed city, his fists clenched, his head bowed slightly in silent grief. The sun sets behind him, casting a golden glow through the dust-filled air. The camera begins a slow, contemplative arc around him, capturing his somber expression from multiple angles as it circles. Sparks flicker in the ruins, distant fires burn quietly, and shattered buildings loom in the blurred background. The camera pauses briefly as the arc frames him against the collapsing skyline. The atmosphere is mournful and heroic. Styling is cinematic realism with a golden-hour color palette, atmospheric haze, lens flares, and subtle slow-motion embers floating through the frame."

    "prompt": "A confident man stands in the middle of a city plaza, surrounded by tall modern buildings glowing in warm afternoon light. He’s dressed in a bright red Adidas tracksuit with bold white stripes and wears futuristic white-framed sunglasses. In his left hand, he grips a vintage silver boombox, angled slightly forward for emphasis. His pose is relaxed yet full of energy, embodying streetwear attitude with a retro-futuristic flair. The camera begins a slow arc to the right, starting from a low angle near his left side and curving steadily to a front-right view. As the camera glides, he lifts his right hand slightly, brushing the edge of his sunglasses with a smooth motion, then smiles — a relaxed, genuine grin full of charisma. The sunlight bounces gently off the frames of his glasses and the metallic surface of the boombox, adding warmth and style to the shot. Maintain smoothness in the arc movement, with no distortion in the face, hands, or accessories. Keep the smile natural and well-lit, without introducing grillz or reflective elements on the teeth. Ensure background architecture shifts consistently with proper perspective, and all reflections on the boombox and sunglasses remain coherent throughout."

    "prompt": "A young woman stands motionless in front of a vibrant gradient wall that shifts from magenta to orange, with bold graffiti-style white text blurred in the background. She wears a glossy, oversized purple puffer jacket adorned with neon-like graphic patches, the hood up, framing her serious gaze. Her face is decorated with colorful sticker decals, and soft colored lighting wraps around her form, creating vivid reflections and cinematic depth. The camera performs a slow arc to the right, beginning from her front-left side and gliding smoothly to a three-quarter right angle. She stays perfectly still throughout, maintaining unbroken eye contact with the lens. As the perspective shifts, the lighting reflections slide across the shiny fabric of the jacket, emphasizing its texture and futuristic design. The background remains consistent, the graffiti text subtly shifting angle but never distorting. Maintain full consistency of light gradients and text size across the arc. No distortion or stretching of the jacket’s material or face stickers. Background must retain its color fade and depth with smooth parallax, and lighting transitions must feel natural on her face and reflective jacket as the camera moves."

    "prompt": "Two stylish individuals pose confidently in a sunlit tunnel, dressed in bold, expressive outfits with vibrant makeup and striking accessories. As they turn slightly and smile into the camera, it begins a smooth arc around them—capturing their confident expressions from multiple angles while the fluorescent-lit tunnel warps gently in the background. Their hands rest casually on each other, exuding connection and poise. The atmosphere is bold and editorial. Styling evokes high-concept fashion photography with wide-angle perspective, soft lens bloom, and vibrant colors. The camera movement enhances their gaze, making them feel powerful and playful as they break the fourth wall."

    "prompt": "An older woman with silver hair, oversized sunglasses, pearls, and a bold pink jacket confidently struts down a city street. The camera performs a playful arc around her, circling as she walks forward with a wide smile and unapologetic flair. The footage is stylized with vintage VHS grain, chromatic aberration, and fisheye lens distortion. Neon shop reflections ripple along the windows as she passes. The background warps slightly with the lens curve, adding to the surreal, retro energy. The atmosphere is fun, bold, and empowered. Styling evokes a vibrant 80s throwback with confident body language, bright fashion, and glitched color trails on movement."

    "prompt": "A young man sits with a composed, almost cinematic calmness in a row of modern metal-and-leather chairs, backed by a pale stone wall. He wears a sleek grey suit with a crisp white shirt and striking red leather gloves resting in his lap. His posture is confident, one leg crossed over the other, his expression neutral yet slightly inquisitive, framed by round glasses and neatly parted dark hair. The camera begins a slow arc to the right, starting from a slight front-left perspective and gradually curving around to a front-right angle. Midway through the movement, the man casually lifts one hand — the one without gloves — and gently adjusts his glasses with two fingers. His expression remains unchanged, calm and self-assured, as the camera captures subtle changes in light across the textures of his suit, gloves, and glasses. Ensure the gesture is natural and minimal, without abrupt motion. Keep the lighting soft and consistent across the arc — no flickering or shifting exposure. Background tiles and chair geometry must remain solid and undistorted. The hand motion should not warp the glasses or face, and reflections on the lenses must remain accurate."

    "prompt": "A man in a full black suit reclines in a leather office chair in the middle of an endless dry steppe, surrounded by vintage office equipment — a CRT monitor, typewriter, rotary phone, and stacked wooden desks. He wears a shiny black helmet with a visor, giving a surreal, humorous twist to the formal setting. One leg is propped confidently on the desk, while his briefcase rests nearby on the grass. Papers flutter lightly in the breeze, and the horizon stretches wide behind him. The camera begins a slow arc-right movement, starting from his front-left side and gliding to his front-right. As it moves, the man animatedly talks on the phone, gesturing expressively with his free hand — fingers slicing through the air, palm open, occasionally pounding lightly on the desk as if emphasizing an urgent point. His posture is relaxed but his face and gestures convey intensity, like he's negotiating something critical despite the absurdity of his surroundings. Ensure hand movement is natural and fluid, with no glitches or jittering. The background landscape must remain consistent with a clean horizon and no parallax errors. Office objects must retain proper proportions with no distortion. Maintain realistic lighting and soft shadows throughout the arc, emphasizing the contrast between corporate seriousness and surreal wilderness."

    "prompt": "A young woman stands still under pouring rain, tears blending with water as they stream down her cheeks. Her face is filled with silent pain—eyes red, lips trembling, rain tracing every line of her expression. The camera begins a slow, delicate arc around her face, capturing the raw emotion from different angles as droplets glisten in the soft, moody lighting. The background fades into dark blue tones, with rain streaks falling in shallow focus. No dialogue—only the sound of rain and breath. The atmosphere is intimate and heart-wrenching. Styling is cinematic naturalism with close-up emotional realism, backlight shimmer on rain, and subtle slow motion."

As the camera sweeps behind her, it reveals the curve of her legs and the sculptural silhouette of the heels against the city skyline. Her stance is confident, her posture defiant — a fashion statue daring the sky."
