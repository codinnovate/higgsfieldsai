The camera tilts down in a smooth, surreal motion, revealing her bare neck, then her shoulders, then beyond — into a lush, humid swamp below. Giant lotus flowers bloom across the water’s surface, their petals dripping with dew. Dozens of colorful frogs—red, blue, emerald—rest quietly among the floating pads, as if awaiting their turn."

The camera slowly tilts down with deliberate grace, the heavy fabric of the cloak cascading into frame as shadows deepen. As the camera continues downward, it reveals the figure’s hands gently cupping a weathered clay pot. Nestled inside the pot is a lush aglaonema plant, its variegated leaves glowing faintly in the low, bluish-green ambient light.

His wide, frightened eyes reflect both fear and deep longing, as flickers of hope fight against the backdrop of war. Each tremor in his hands echoes the fragility of love in such a brutal world."
