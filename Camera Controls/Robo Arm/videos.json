    "prompt": "A woman in a sharp, sculptural red dress stands on the upper level of a modernist building, the sun casting deep shadows across the sleek white façade behind her. Her posture is poised and distant, one hand draped elegantly over the steel railing. She holds a small navy handbag, and her face is set in a quiet expression of control, her hair slicked back and sculptural. Harsh light carves geometric patterns across her dress and the surrounding architecture, reinforcing the minimalist power of the scene. Angle 1: The camera begins from a low angle, looking up as she gazes downward, her face partially in shadow. The sun behind the corner of the building flares softly into frame. The lines of the architecture and her body form a sharp diagonal composition, giving the frame a feeling of tension and stillness. Angle 2: The camera flies around her, revealing her from the other side — she now stands motionless, but perched on her shoulder is a vibrant green iguana. The shift is surreal. The animal blinks slowly while she stares into the distance, statuesque. In this new scene, the wind catches her dress ever so slightly, and the iguana shifts its claws against her fabric. Her face is calm, but the reptile’s presence adds an otherworldly contrast. Angle 3: The camera floats back behind her, looking upward toward the clean verticals of the building. The iguana climbs gently toward her neck. She tilts her chin upward, letting the light trace across her jaw and collarbone. Shadows stretch across the concrete as the world falls quiet — fashion, nature, and control blending in a visual meditation."

    "prompt": "A man with long braids sits alone at a low wooden table in a dimly lit Japanese restaurant. He wears a surreal, pleated pink headpiece that frames his face like a sculptural halo — bold and theatrical against the minimalist surroundings. Tatami mats line the floor, and soft amber lanterns glow overhead, casting warm, dappled light across shoji screens and hand-painted scrolls hanging on the walls. He leans in with focused grace, chopsticks delicately lifting a tangle of steaming ramen noodles toward his lips. A lacquered soup spoon rests gently in his other hand, poised above the deep ceramic bowl with a hand-brushed crown motif. Angle 1: The camera starts tight on his face as he slurps the noodles in slow motion. The ornate pink headpiece ripples slightly with his movement, illuminated by warm lantern glow. Behind him, the restaurant’s quiet elegance frames his stillness. Angle 2: The camera swings to the side, revealing the full setting: a long counter lined with silent patrons, each immersed in their meals. A chef behind an open bar flame-sears a piece of fish, the motion captured in a blur of orange. The man’s bowl steams gently as he lowers his spoon into the broth, his expression serene. Angle 3: The camera glides behind his shoulder, showing his back now slightly straighter. In this new moment, he has paused mid-meal, his gaze drifting toward a low wooden stage where a performer in a Noh mask begins a slow, hypnotic dance. His pink headpiece casts petal-like shadows onto the wall behind him as he watches, entranced."
