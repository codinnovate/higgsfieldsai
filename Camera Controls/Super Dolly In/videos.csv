The landscape feels stark and surreal — muted gray skies stretch above, with an enormous white sun dominating the horizon, its glow cold and unnatural. The crimson cliffs frame the scene, their jagged edges contrasting with the stillness of the water. The camera starts wide. The figure is distant, almost swallowed by the vastness of the landscape. The pale reflection of the sun ripples across the water, drawing a glowing path toward the figure. The camera slowly begins to zoom in — the figure’s outline sharpens. A dark silhouette against the glowing reflection, their arms are slightly outstretched, as if reaching for balance or calling for something unseen. The zoom intensifies, pressing closer — the figure’s details become clearer: a man in a dark suit, his clothes damp and clinging to his frame. His head tilts upward, staring directly at the colossal sun above. His expression is obscured."

https://static.higgsfield.ai/ad8b7ea9-f74a-45f4-8fe0-f692bf6a868e.mp4,"A group of six individuals stands in a desolate clearing surrounded by barren trees, their twisted branches clawing at the pitch-black night sky. The ground is dry, cracked earth, littered with scattered leaves. A single overhead light casts harsh shadows, illuminating the group in stark contrast against the encroaching darkness. The group is arranged in a tense formation — one man in a dark suit stands at the center, his posture rigid, his gaze locked directly on the camera.

The camera slowly pushes forward, the trees receding into the void. The group remains still, yet the weight of their presence intensifies as the camera inches closer. The focus sharpens on the standing man — his face stoic, jaw clenched. The zoom continues, closing in further. The man’s face sharpens — his brow furrowed, a bead of sweat glistening at his temple.
