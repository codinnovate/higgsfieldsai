    "prompt": "The camera starts with a static wide or overhead shot. It then performs a single, fast crash zoom into the subject’s face or body, followed by one sharp pullback to the original wide frame. The motion is smooth and dramatic, enhancing the surreal stillness of the subject within the scene. All existing elements in the environment maintain their natural movement, while the lighting remains cinematic and shadows consistent. The animation emphasizes the contrast between movement and stillness, drawing attention to the central character."
