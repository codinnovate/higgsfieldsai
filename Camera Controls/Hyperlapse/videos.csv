The camera dolly out, slowing as it approaches two women seen from behindâ€”one seated in a white hoodie, the other standing in a black dress with sleek blonde hair. Outside the rain-speckled window, neon lights from passing city streets blur into pink and red streams. As the camera floats the outside world continues racing by, casting shifting hues across their still figures. The reflection of the neon softly pulses across the glass and their silhouettes, evoking a melancholic, dreamlike mood."
