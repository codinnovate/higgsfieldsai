He begins walking confidently toward a sleek yellow Lamborghini parked in front of a large garage door. The camera starts at ground level behind him, then performs a slow, dramatic crane up, rising smoothly to reveal more of the car and the massive space around him. Moody lighting creates sharp reflections on the polished floor. The scene should feel cinematic, intense, and powerful — like the buildup before a major event.ohwx tchnq"

Her face rests gently on a bun, eyes staring forward, expression calm and distant. As the camera continues upward, the table of scattered lettuce, tomatoes, and garlic is revealed in full, arranged like a feast.

Coins, receipts, and scattered pills surround him like remnants of a fallen life. Cars blur past on either side, streaks of red and white light slicing through the night. As the camera ascends higher, the chaos below begins to shrink. We pass glowing signs, rain-slicked streets, and eventually rise above the intersection—revealing a giant billboard of the same man, smiling in a polished ad campaign. The world keeps moving."

A pure white dove elegantly takes flight from his finger, ascending gently into the air.
