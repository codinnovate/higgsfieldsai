The muzzle flash erupts — a violent burst of light and flame illuminating the metallic surface. The camera lingers on the gun’s details — the spinning cylinder, the hammer still recoiling, smoke curling from the chamber. Then, slowly shift focus past the weapon to reveal the woman’s face — her expression cold, her gaze locked with ruthless intensity. Her blonde hair is slightly tousled, and her leather jacket clings tightly against her tense shoulders. Her knuckles are clenched white around the gun. Hold the focus on her piercing stare, the faint smoke drifting in the air, before fading to a wide shot of the barren landscape behind her — empty, silent, and vast — a stark contrast to the violence that just unfolded. The echo of the gunshot fades as the tension lingers."

Her profile dominates the left side of the frame, her gaze fixed on something distant. The background is stark white, with a striking red fabric stretched across the floor like a runway. Shift focus to reveal a sleek, black-clad figure walking confidently across the red fabric — a bold presence in contrast to the soft blur of the foreground. The figure’s reflection ripples across a mirror-like pool, adding depth and distortion. Gradually, pull focus back to the blurred face in the foreground, now sharpening just enough to reveal her tense expression — eyes following the distant figure with quiet intensity. Keep the lighting stark and minimal, emphasizing the contrast between the red fabric and the crisp white backdrop."

Gradually and smoothly shift the lens focus toward the vibrant background, clearly revealing a lively Korean urban street scene, including neon-lit signs, city lights, and bustling activities around a Korean supermarket. Maintain the evening's warm ambient lighting, subtle reflections in his sunglasses, and introduce gentle camera movements for added cinematic realism."
