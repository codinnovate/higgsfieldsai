    "prompt": "A stylish young man sits confidently on a mustard-yellow couch in a retro-styled room, wearing gold jewelry, amber-tinted sunglasses, plaid pants, and a cream-colored T-shirt that reads “we change the game.” Large over-ear headphones cover his ears as music flows through him.

The styling blends retro aesthetics with a modern edge, emphasizing individuality and good vibes. The scene feels like a celebration of rhythm and identity, subtle yet full of life."
