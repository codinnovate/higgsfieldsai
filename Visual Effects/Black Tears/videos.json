    "prompt": "A cinematic hyperrealistic video prompt. A mysterious woman stands in front of a rusted blue metal wall. She wears a white headwrap and face cover, only her piercing eyes are visible. The lighting is sharp and dramatic, casting clean shadows. The camera is locked in a close-up on her face and chest. She blinks slowly. Her eyes shift slightly as if following something just outside the frame. Then, from both eyes, thick black tears begin to slide down — slow and viscous, like ink. As the tears flow downward, they soak into the white face covering. The fabric beneath her eyes gradually stains with spreading black splotches, like ink bleeding into cotton. The longer the tears fall, the darker and wider the stains grow, absorbing into the cloth with a realistic wicking effect. The rest of the scene remains still. The rusted background doesn’t move. Only her subtle head motion and the spreading ink mark the passage of time. The result is haunting, poetic, and silent."

    "prompt": "A cinematic hyperrealistic video prompt: A stylish woman in an orange flame cap and vivid makeup stares directly into the camera. Her lips are painted black, revealing rainbow-colored teeth as she touches her lower lip with a single gloved finger. The camera remains locked in a sharp, centered close-up. Slowly, she lowers her finger from her lips and brings it upward in a sleek, controlled motion, lightly touching the skin just beneath her eye. The moment her finger approaches her face, thick rainbow-colored tears begin to stream from both eyes — glowing trails of vivid color flowing smoothly down her pale cheeks. The fluid is bright and saturated: red, blue, green, yellow, violet — blending like melted neon candy. Her expression is calm, confident, almost challenging. The lighting remains high-contrast, dramatic, and fashion-forward — no flickering or color shift. Her glove, earrings, and necklace stay perfectly sharp and unmoving, emphasizing the surreal juxtaposition of emotion and control. The tears continue to flow as her finger hovers near the eye, as if she’s about to smear the colors further."

    "prompt": "A cinematic hyperrealistic video prompt: A stylish man in a blue cap worn backwards and covered in heavy gold jewelry stands still against a soft mint-green background. His nose is taped with a bright red stripe, and both index fingers rest along the sides of the tape. The camera is locked in a close-up portrait frame. Slowly, he tilts his head slightly backward in a powerful, effortless gesture. His eyes remain open and fixed on the camera, full of cool confidence. As he moves, thick electric-blue tears begin to stream from his eyes — the same saturated tone as his cap. The liquid flows downward over his face, cutting directly across the bright red nose strip and continuing along his fingers. The tears coat his skin and trail over the glossy nail art and rings, eventually dripping off the tips of his hands. His face stays perfectly composed, bold and untouchable, with a subtle smirk of superiority. Lighting is clean and even. Maintain the glossy details: the texture of the skin, reflection on the jewelry, and saturated bold colors. No flicker. No background shift. This is high-gloss, pop-styled surrealism — iconic and controlled."

    "prompt": "A cinematic hyperrealistic video prompt: A striking young woman with twin braids, bold makeup, and black lipstick stands outdoors in front of a gas station. She wears a black and white outfit and holds up a small doll head by its topknot — a hyperrealistic miniature of herself, with identical piercings and face paint. The camera is locked in a close-up shot centered on her face and the doll. Suddenly, thick black tears begin to stream from the woman’s eyes — smooth, symmetrical, and bold. The glossy liquid slides down her cheeks, crossing over her facial piercings and makeup without distortion. Her expression remains stone-cold and intense. At the same time, tiny black tears begin to flow from the doll’s eyes as well — subtler, thinner, but perfectly timed and positioned. The doll’s expression remains frozen with its tongue out, yet the tears mirror the woman’s perfectly in rhythm and angle. Both faces — full-sized and miniature — display this surreal emotion with style and eerie clarity. Lighting stays strong and consistent. The urban background remains untouched. The tears never glitch or flicker — they fall clean, controlled, and iconic."

    "prompt": "A dramatic close-up portrait of a glamorous woman with styled retro curls and intense eye makeup, wearing a glossy red satin shirt. Thick, shiny black tears stream symmetrically from her eyes, running down her cheeks. As the tears reach the large pink bubblegum bubble she is blowing, the gum bursts mid-air in fragments. The woman's eyes blink in surprise at the moment of the pop. High-detail beauty lighting, clean white background, high-fashion magazine style, cinematic editorial photography."

    "prompt": "A glamorous woman in a pink outfit confidently stares into the camera, her face adorned with multiple realistic eyes—on her forehead, cheeks, sides, and chin. Each eye is perfectly blended with her skin and makeup, showcasing vibrant blue irises and styled lashes. In a surreal moment, all her eyes blink simultaneously, followed by thick, glossy pink tears streaming down her face. The vivid fabric of the tears contrasts beautifully with her smooth skin and cool-toned blue eye makeup as they flow in elegant trails around her lips, cheekbones, and chin. Her expression remains statuesque and composed, exuding a powerful yet alien allure. The background is stark white, enhancing the sharp, glossy lighting that highlights her skin texture and shimmer, creating an atmosphere of surreal beauty."

    "prompt": "A hyperrealistic cinematic video prompt: A young woman with long dark hair sits in the backseat of a car, dressed in a dark hoodie and a camo cap labeled “GOD’S FAVORITE.” The camera is fixed in a steady, close frontal shot. Slowly and confidently, she lifts her right hand and fully removes the cap from her head, revealing her entire face. As the cap comes off, we see her full beauty — expressive eyes, sculpted brows, glowing skin, and a bold, confident expression. At the same time, thick black tears begin to stream from her eyes, sliding gracefully down her cheeks and dripping from her chin. The motion is slow and dramatic, emphasizing the surreal contrast between her striking face and the dark fluid. She locks eyes with the camera — calm, untouchable, powerful. The lighting remains soft and golden, with no flicker or exposure shifts. The background stays completely stable: a warm car interior with sunlit edges and shadowed curves. The cap stays in her hand as she lowers it slightly out of frame, completing the silent reveal."

    "prompt": "A hyperrealistic cinematic video prompt: A young woman with deep dark skin, short bleached hair, and a glossy black hooded jacket stares directly into the camera with calm, quiet intensity. The shot is perfectly centered and still. Her entire background is pure studio white — clean, flat, and evenly lit. Without blinking, shimmering silver tears begin to stream slowly from both her eyes. The liquid is thick, metallic, and luminous — like molten chrome — trailing down her face in perfect symmetry. The silver fluid reflects highlights and glides over her cheekbones with quiet elegance, creating a surreal contrast against her rich skin tone and black vinyl jacket. ⚠️ The white background must remain perfectly pure throughout the entire sequence — no shadows, no gray shift, no tone flicker. Lighting must stay absolutely consistent, preserving the cold, minimal, editorial feel of the studio. Her expression stays still and powerful. There is no camera movement — all the visual tension comes from her gaze and the slow movement of the silver tears."
